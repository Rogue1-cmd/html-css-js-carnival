            <p>
                In curves and lines, a soft embrace, <br>
                Thick girls bring warmth to any space. <br>
                Their arms invite, their hearts so kind,<br>
                In their embrace, solace you'll find.
            </p>
            <p>    
                With every hug, a gentle hold,<br>
                Their presence comforts, never cold. <br>
                In their embrace, worries melt away,<br>
                Thick girls were made for cuddling, they say.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Their laughter fills the air with cheer, <br>
                In their arms, there's nothing to fear. <br>
                For in their curves, love's sweet nest, <br>
                Thick girls cuddle, and hearts find rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let the world sing praises true, <br>
                For thick girls bring joy in all they do. <br>
                In their embrace, love unfurls, <br>
                For thick girls were made for cuddling, dear world.
            </p>
